// The lexical structure of JavaScript is:

/*
 * Case sensitivity, spaces, and line breaks
 * Comments
 * Literals
 * Identifiers and reserved words
 * Unicode
 * Optional semicolons
 */

/*This is a line comment*/ console.log("I'm inside!!!") // And this is a code comment

let a = 4; let b = 5;
console.log(a, b);

let g; g = 3; console.log(g);

/*
return
true;

JavaScript understands:
return; true;

However, you meant:
return true;



So be careful!
